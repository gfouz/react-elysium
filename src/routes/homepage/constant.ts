first experience with Arduino boards. But it was a kind of
hobby until year 2019 that i began studying web programming with a
better purpose in mind. So that Node js was my pick, i have been
studying back-end frameworks like Express, and related libraries to
afford security and functionality, besides very useful concepts to
reuse logic such as middlewares and i have had experience working with
ORM or ODM to abstract databases such as Sequelize or Mongoose. I have
designed and abstracted databases for a System that will afford PKI
services in Cuba. `;

export const attached_2 = `React is open-sourced by Facebook just a shy a few years ago, it’s
already become the number one choice for JavaScript devs around the
globe. And i have picked to work with this wonderful technology that
brings so many advantages. However Technology changes, and it changes
quickly. I am open-minded to new technologies in order to learn them
and then also take advantage of them. I currently use react libraries
such as react-hook-form, react-query, valtio, zustand,
styled-components and the popular react-router-dom.`;

certificates for Segurmática which is the information security company in Cuba, 
I participated in the creation or abstraction of the database in this case relational 
using PostgreSQL and Sequelize as ORM. As well as designed the Rest Api of routes and 
controllers with Express and Node. Use React to create the front end or the representation 
of the client or browser side, this system has great importance for the development 
of digital certification in Cuba.<p>(PKI) project: <a src="https://github.com/gfouz/pki-server-2023">
